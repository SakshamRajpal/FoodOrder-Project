Excited to share my latest Web Development Project "QuickBite", a food ordering website that allows users to order variety of cuisines from their home with hassle-free online payment.
⚡ Technologies Used:-
-Backend: node.js
-Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React.js
-Database: MongoDb
-API Used: Postman

📑 Features:-
🛒Streamlined Ordering via ExpressJS: Designed ExpressJS-based ordering system for smooth cart management, item addition/removal, and quantity updates.
🌐Media Management using Cloudinary.
🔐User Authentication: Secure login and logout functionality using Mailtrap.
💰Payment Integration: Complete payment processing using Stripe.
📲Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout for optimal use on all devices using "Redux".

I also want to share some important concepts that i have learned while making this project:-
✔️The correct use of Bootstrap can take your project to an amazing level as it provides responsiveness, browser friendliness and different templates.
✔️MongoDb is one of the best database that can be used as it used JSON format to store the data which also provide encryption of users credentials like password, name etc..with the help of JSON Web Token.
✔️You should always have the basic understanding of React hooks such as useState, useEffect, useSelector etc... as it is widely used in frontend.
✔️Instead of just using a normal anchor tag, you should use tags of "React-Router-Dom" like BrowserRouter, Route and Link as it helps in client-side routing instead of making a full page reload.
✔️Always test your code time by time as it will save debugging time later.
✔️Always try to distribute the task with the help of creation of multiple files in your code editor.
✔️At last, while working with this project i have also come across different platforms like Mailtrap, Stripe which i found useful for begineers.

I am still working on the deployment of this project, still then you can view my project code at my github link:-🔗https://lnkd.in/gMKuu8Um
